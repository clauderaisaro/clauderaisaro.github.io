#This paper studies the role of financial incentives in mitigating harmful norms. Beyond monetary gains, I hypothesize that financial incentives are more powerful when they help justify choices otherwise costly among peers. I test this hypothesis on a high-stakes and widespread harmful behavior in low-income countries: overspeeding. Multiple experiments with 360 motortaxi groups in Uganda show that: (i) drivers' demand for financial incentives to limit speeding increases when the contract can also be used as a justification, (ii) the availability of a justification doubles the effectiveness of the financial incentives, increasing speed limit compliance by 45 percent compared to no incentives, and (iii) labor supply is not affected regardless of the visibility of incentives, while productivity increases more with incentives that help justify one's action with colleagues. My findings highlight how, in the presence of harmful norms, financial incentives can be significantly more powerful than their payoffs effects because they help undermining the behavioral grip of bad norms.
