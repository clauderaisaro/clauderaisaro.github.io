abstract: This project studies the effect of reducing sales uncertainty on farmers’ earnings and competition among purchasers. We partner with the largest purchaser of vanilla in Uganda in 10 districts. Our partner agribusiness (henceforth Partner) promotes organic farming and fair trade and represents the best buyer for vanilla farmers. Yet, the presence of several middle-men and the uncertainty around the international market usually press farmers into selling their products at a lower price. In particular, we collected anecdotal evidence that middle-men are systematically purchasing vanilla before the date set by the Ugandan government, sometimes spreading misleading information about the Partner not showing up in the upcoming vanilla season.
