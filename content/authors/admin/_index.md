I am an Assistant Professor in Economics at the Geneva Graduate Institute [IHEID](https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/faculty/claude-raisaro) and a research affiliate at the [Centre for Finance and Development](https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/cfd). I am also affiliated to the [Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets](https://www.hhs.se/en/research/institutes/misum-startpage/) at Stockholm School of Economics.
I work at the intersection of development and behavioral economics. My research focuses on how social norms influence the functioning of markets.
